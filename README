# selenoprofiles

Selenoprofiles is a pipeline for profile-based protein finding in genomes. It runs internally blast, exonerate and genewise. It is suitable also (but not only) for prediction of selenoproteins. See page: http://big.crg.cat/services/selenoprofiles

For installation instructions, please run:      python install_selenoprofiles.py --help
