Selenoprofiles is a pipeline for profile-based protein finding in genomes. It runs internally blast, exonerate and genewise. It is suitable also (but not only) for prediction of selenoproteins. See page: https://genome.crg.es/software/selenoprofiles/

For installation instructions, please run:      python install_selenoprofiles.py --help

For its practical use, see the included manual (selenoprofiles_manual.pdf) or the latest publication (Santesmasses et al, 2018) below.
